WORK IN PROGRESS

# A collection of mapping tools including:

- **Mapping, Listen, Dedicated Server, Insecure** (tweaked [zer0k.z tools](https://github.com/zer0k-z/cs2kz-mapping))
- **[Source2Viewer](https://s2v.app/)** launcher with auto updating feature
- **CS2 Importer** (inspired by [sarim-hk](https://github.com/sarim-hk/cs2-map-importer) and [andreaskeller96](https://github.com/andreaskeller96/cs2-import-scripts))
- **Skybox Converter**, converts single cubemap faces to a source2 suitable format
- **Loading Screen**, fast and easy loading screen things
- **Point Worldtext**, make csgo style point_worldtext in cs2
- **VTF to PNG**
- **Sounds**, add sounds easier (kinda janky rn, works sometimes)
